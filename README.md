## 💡 Integration Not Listed?

**Is your integration missing from the available list during configuration?**

Device Pulse can monitor most IP-based integrations, but some require custom configuration parsing.

👉 **[Read how to request a custom host resolver](HOST_RESOLVER_REQUEST.md)**

*Please note: Not all integrations can be supported, and implementation depends on the information provided and device availability for testing.*

## Basic Functionality

### Configuration Modes

1. **Integration-based Monitoring**\
   Device Pulse can automatically detect existing Home Assistant integrations that expose device connection parameters such as `ip_address`, `ipaddress`, `host`, `hostname`, or `address`.\
   You can then select one of these integrations to monitor its devices.

  <img src="https://github.com/studiobts/home-assistant-device-pulse/blob/main/images/config_flow_mode.png?raw=true" height="350" />
  <img src="https://github.com/studiobts/home-assistant-device-pulse/blob/main/images/config_flow_integration.png?raw=true" height="350" />
</p>

   During setup, you can specify which devices to monitor:   

   - **All valid devices** – all devices with a valid host parameter.
   - **All except listed devices** – exclude specific devices listed during configuration.
   - **Only listed devices** – include only the specified devices.

<p float="left">
  <img src="https://github.com/studiobts/home-assistant-device-pulse/blob/main/images/config_flow_device_selection.png?raw=true" height="350" />
</p>

2. **Custom Group Monitoring**\
   You can manually create a custom group and add devices by specifying their **name** and **host (hostname or IP)**. Each group can be configured independently.


### Monitoring Parameters

For both configuration modes, you can define:

- The **number of failed ping attempts** required before a device is considered disconnected.
- The **interval time** between each ping request.
- The **ping method** to use (ICMP or ARP).

<p float="left">
  <img src="https://github.com/studiobts/home-assistant-device-pulse/blob/main/images/config_flow_ping_parameters.png?raw=true" height="350" />
</p>

### Ping Method Selection

Device Pulse supports two ping methods for monitoring devices:

- **ICMP Ping (Standard)**: Uses the traditional ICMP protocol to check device availability. Works for any device on any network (local or remote).

- **ARP Ping (Local Subnet Only)**: Uses ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) requests to check device availability. Only works for devices in the same local subnet as Home Assistant, but it's more reliable for devices that don't respond to ICMP ping (some devices have ICMP disabled for security reasons).

**Note**: The ARP Ping option is only shown if at least one device is detected to be in the same subnet as Home Assistant. ARP ping requires the `arping` command to be installed on your system:

```bash
# For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems (including Home Assistant OS)
apt-get install iputils-arping
```

If you're using hostnames instead of IP addresses, Device Pulse will automatically resolve them to determine subnet compatibility and will resolve them at runtime when using ARP ping.

## Advanced Features

### Optional Supplementary Sensors

You can choose to create additional sensors for each monitored device to track:

- The number of failed pings.
- The total number of failed pings since the last manual reset.
- The timestamp of the last offline event.
- The round-trip time of the most recent ping.

<p float="left">
  <img src="https://github.com/studiobts/home-assistant-device-pulse/blob/main/images/config_flow_optional_sensors.png?raw=true" height="450" />
</p>

### Summary Sensors per Integration or Group

Each integration or custom group can have two summary sensors:

- The **total number of monitored devices**.
- The **number of offline devices**.

### Global Summary Sensors

Device Pulse automatically creates three global summary sensors:

1. A sensor for the **total number of devices** under monitoring.
2. A **binary sensor** indicating whether all devices are online.
3. A sensor showing the **total number of offline devices**.

### Attributes for Offline Summary Sensors

Sensors that track the number of offline devices (both per group and globally) expose three attributes:

- `offline_device_ids`: list of device IDs currently offline.
- `went_offline_device_ids`: list of device IDs that went offline in the most recent update.
- `came_online_device_ids`: list of device IDs that came back online in the most recent update.

These attributes allow for easy automation and dynamic UI cards showing current offline devices.

### Total Failed Pings Counter

The optional **Total Failed Pings** sensor counts every failed ping and does not reset automatically when the device comes back online. It exposes `count_started_at`, which stores when the current counting period started.

The counter can be reset from the generated reset button or programmatically:

```yaml
service: device_pulse.reset_total_failed_pings
target:
  entity_id: sensor.example_device_total_failed_pings
```

> **Note:** Home Assistant does not currently allow this service target selector to be filtered only to the **Total Failed Pings** sensors. When selecting a device, area, floor, or label, the UI may show an entity count that is higher than the counters that will actually be reset. Device Pulse validates the target internally and resets only the matching **Total Failed Pings** counters.

Resetting the counter sets the value to `0` and updates `count_started_at` to the current timestamp.

### Custom Events

Device Pulse emits custom events that can be used for advanced automations and tracking device state changes:

- `device_pulse_ping_status_updated`: Triggered whenever the ping status of any monitored device sensor changes (from online to offline or vice versa).
- `device_pulse_device_went_offline`: Triggered when a device transitions from online to offline. The event data includes the device ID.
- `device_pulse_device_came_online`: Triggered when a device transitions from offline back to online. The event data includes the device ID.
- `device_pulse_total_failed_pings_reset`: Triggered whenever the total failed pings counter is reset.

These events can be used in automations to trigger notifications, log changes, or synchronize external systems with real-time network status.

## Configuration Parsing

Not all integrations have a straightforward configuration structure where the host can be easily identified. 

For integrations with complex or "non-standard" configuration formats, you can create a dedicated resolver class to handle proper configuration parsing.

### Creating a Custom Resolver

To implement a custom resolver:
- Create a new file in the `host_resolvers` directory named with the integration's domain
- **Extend BaseHostResolver**: Your class must inherit from the base resolver class
- **Implement the `resolve` method**: Return the host for the specific device

### Current Custom Resolvers

At the moment, the following custom resolvers are implemented:

- Midea Dehumidifier LAN
- Tasmota
- LocalTuya
- Open Sprinkler
- Jellyfin
- Pi-hole
- qBittorrent

## Requesting a New Host Resolver

If you need support for an integration that is not currently listed, please refer to the instructions in the file [HOST_RESOLVER_REQUEST](HOST_RESOLVER_REQUEST.md).  
It explains the required information and how to submit a request for a new custom host resolver.
